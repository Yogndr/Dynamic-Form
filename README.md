# Dynamic Form Implementation in React
## ObjectiveThis project demonstrates a dynamic form implementation using React. The form fields are generated based on a backend API response and adjust dynamically based on user selections (e.g., selecting different options from a dropdown changes the form structure).
---
## Features
- Form fields are dynamically generated based on mock API responses.- Form structure updates dynamically as users interact with dropdowns or other input fields.
- Demonstrates the use of React's state and props to handle dynamic UI updates.

## Examples of User Interactions
1. Dynamic Dropdown Selection:     Selecting an option in one dropdown dynamically updates the available fields in the form.
   - Example: Selecting "User Type" as "Admin" displays additional fields such as "Admin Code."
2. Conditional Input Fields:     Certain fields appear or disappear based on specific inputs.
   - Example: Checking a "Do you have pets?" checkbox displays a "Number of Pets" input field.
3. Multi-step Form Progression:     Based on selections, users may be guided to additional steps in the form dynamically.
